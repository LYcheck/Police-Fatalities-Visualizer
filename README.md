# Police-Shootings-Visualizer
This project was created in an attempt to illustrate each fatal event in the USA of which police were involved - updated as of August 2020.

I wanted to give these events attention - match a story to the time and place, and then give the user an option to educate themselves on the transpired tragedy.

Through data transformation & filtering, necessary elements were extracted - such as geospatial coordinates, personal characteristics, reference links - in order to properly do justice for the victims.

Deck.gl was used in tandem with Google Maps API, using pure Javascript as a binding agent, to bring this project to life.
Shown below are over-the-counter views of the landing page:
